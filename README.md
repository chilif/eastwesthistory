# A Year in World History: East vs. West

This webpage offers a timeline of world history comparing the east and the west. Specifically, it highlights known historical events that occured in the east and the west around the same time.

This idea came from my own frustration studying history in my childhood in Taiwan where Eastern history and Western history have always been taught separately. When one was taught, very little reference was made to the other even though we might have just learned it in the previous semester. When studying Chinese history, I often wondered what was going on in Europe at that time; when studying European and American history, I found it difficult to associate the events to what I know in Asian history. It was as if two different worlds existed in different space and time, with no association between them.

I believe seeing which events happened in the east and in the west around the same time would give us contextual knowledge that will help us connect what we already know, and humanity and the world as a whole more holistically (and I probably would've got better grades if I had done this long time ago).

I was lucky to find a number of useful sources to begin this project (see below). I will continue to add more years and events, but in the initial stage, Chinese history will be the focus for the East and Europe as the focus for the West. This dichotomy of East vs West is more convenient than definitional.

## 2800-2100BC
In ancient China, it was known to be the time of the [Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sovereigns_and_Five_Emperors) among which the best known figure is the [Yellow Emporer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Emperor) who is probably more like god than a ruling emporer. He is considered to be the ancestor of all Chinese and is credited for many creations and innovations. Around the same time, the [Great Pyramid of Giza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza) was built in Egypt by Pharaoh Khufu (2560BC); Maya culture emerged in the Yucatán Peninsula in Southeastern Mexico); and the Indus Valley Civilisation in present-day northeast Afghanistan to Pakistan and northwest India enter the mature period (2600–1900 BC).
