## A Year in World History: East vs. West

This webpage offers a timeline of world history comparing the east and the west. Specifically, it highlights known historical events that occured in the east and the west at the same time.

This idea came from my own frustration studying history in middle school and high school in Taiwan where Eastern history and Western history have always been taught separately. When one was taught, very little reference was made to the other even though we might have just learned it in the previous semester. When studying Chinese history, I often wondered what was going on in Europe at that time; when studying European and American history, I found it difficult to associate the events to what I know in Asian history. It was as if two different worlds existed in different space and time, with no association between them.

I believe seeing which events happened in the east and in the west around the same time would give us contextual knowledge that will help us connect what we already know about the two worlds, and the world as a whole more holistically (and I probably would've got better grades if I had done this).

I was lucky to find a number of useful sources to begin this project, which will be cited in each post. I will continue to add more years and events, but in the initial stage, Chinese history will be the focus for the East and Europe as the focus for the West. This dichotomy of East vs West is also more convenient than definitional.
